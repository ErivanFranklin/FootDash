# Architecture Notes

This directory is the working location for living architecture documentation as we migrate toward the Phase 1 scaffold.

## Documents
- `phase-1-scaffold-plan.md` – target folder structures, CLI steps, and conventions for the NestJS + Angular architecture.
- `phase-1-development-plan.md` – milestone-driven delivery roadmap for the MVP.
- `technical-architecture-overview.md` – narrative explanation of the client/server stack and security considerations.
- `architecture-diagram.md` – embeds the latest architecture visual for quick reference.

Additional plans from the `prompt/` directory can be moved or summarised here as they become the engineering source of truth.
